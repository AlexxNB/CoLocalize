# CoLocolize
Simple tool for making your own localization platform. Simple installation on a server with PHP&amp;MySQL.

Just started a dev of my own platform for localizing apps, websites and etc. As source of translation should be any file that can be represnt as "key=value" type document. At the start system will support only Android's string.xml  doctype.

*UPDATE*:
The project is suspensed now. Never will be released.
